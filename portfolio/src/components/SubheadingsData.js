                        I have recently completed "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023" course by Colt Steele on Udemy. 
                        This intensive bootcamp equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of web development concepts, 
                        tools, and techniques. Under Colt Steele's guidance, I acquired practical skills in front-end and back-end 
                        development, along with a solid grasp of modern web technologies. This course has further enhanced my proficiency
                         as a web developer and prepared me for real-world projects.
